<!--Bee Movie Script-->
    <div class="red">According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.</div>
    <div class="green">Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.</div>
    <div class="pink">The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.</div>
    <div class="orange">Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.</div>
    <div class="blue">Ooh, black and yellow!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Let's shake it up a little.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Barry! Breakfast is ready!</div>
    <div class="purple">Coming!</div>
    <div class="white">Hang on a second.</div>
    <div class="violet">Hello?</div>
    <div class="red">Barry?</div>
    <div class="green">Adam?</div>
    <div class="pink">Can you believe this is happening?</div>
    <div class="orange">I can't.</div>
    <div class="blue">I'll pick you up.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Looking sharp.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.</div>
    <div class="purple">Sorry. I'm excited.</div>
    <div class="white">Here's the graduate.</div>
    <div class="violet">We're very proud of you, son.</div>
    <div class="red">A perfect report card, all B's.</div>
    <div class="green">Very proud.</div>
    <div class="pink">Ma! I got a thing going here.</div>
    <div class="orange">You got lint on your fuzz.</div>
    <div class="blue">Ow! That's me!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Bye!</div>
    <div class="purple">Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!</div>
    <div class="white">Hey, Adam.</div>
    <div class="violet">Hey, Barry.</div>
    <div class="red">Is that fuzz gel?</div>
    <div class="green">A little. Special day, graduation.</div>
    <div class="pink">Never thought I'd make it.</div>
    <div class="orange">Three days grade school, three days high school.</div>
    <div class="blue">Those were awkward.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">You did come back different.</div>
    <div class="purple">Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.</div>
    <div class="white">Hear about Frankie?</div>
    <div class="violet">Yeah.</div>
    <div class="red">You going to the funeral?</div>
    <div class="green">No, I'm not going.</div>
    <div class="pink">Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.</div>
    <div class="orange">Don't waste it on a squirrel.</div>
    <div class="blue">Such a hothead.</div>
    <div class="yellow">I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.</div>
    <div class="purple">That's why we don't need vacations.</div>
    <div class="white">Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.</div>
    <div class="violet">Well, Adam, today we are men.</div>
    <div class="red">We are!</div>
    <div class="green">Bee-men.</div>
    <div class="pink">Amen!</div>
    <div class="orange">Hallelujah!</div>
    <div class="blue">Students, faculty, distinguished bees,</div>
    <div class="yellow">please welcome Dean Buzzwell.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.</div>
    <div class="purple">That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!</div>
    <div class="white">Will we pick our job today?</div>
    <div class="violet">I heard it's just orientation.</div>
    <div class="red">Heads up! Here we go.</div>
    <div class="green">Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.</div>
    <div class="pink">Wonder what it'll be like?</div>
    <div class="orange">A little scary.</div>
    <div class="blue">Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.</div>
    <div class="yellow">This is it!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Wow.</div>
    <div class="purple">Wow.</div>
    <div class="white">We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.</div>
    <div class="violet">Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.</div>
    <div class="red">Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!</div>
    <div class="green">That girl was hot.</div>
    <div class="pink">She's my cousin!</div>
    <div class="orange">She is?</div>
    <div class="blue">Yes, we're all cousins.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Right. You're right.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.</div>
    <div class="purple">These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.</div>
    <div class="white">What do you think he makes?</div>
    <div class="violet">Not enough.</div>
    <div class="red">Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.</div>
    <div class="green">What does that do?</div>
    <div class="pink">Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.</div>
    <div class="orange">Saves us millions.</div>
    <div class="blue">Can anyone work on the Krelman?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.</div>
    <div class="purple">But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.</div>
    <div class="white">The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.</div>
    <div class="violet">What's the difference?</div>
    <div class="red">You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.</div>
    <div class="green">So you'll just work us to death?</div>
    <div class="pink">We'll sure try.</div>
    <div class="orange">Wow! That blew</div>
    <div class="red">"What's the difference?"</div>
    <div class="green">How can you say that?</div>
    <div class="pink">One job forever?</div>
    <div class="orange">That's an insane choice to have to make.</div>
    <div class="blue">I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.</div>
    <div class="yellow">But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Why would you question anything? We're bees.</div>
    <div class="purple">We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.</div>
    <div class="white">You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?</div>
    <div class="violet">Like what? Give me one example.</div>
    <div class="red">I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.</div>
    <div class="green">Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.</div>
    <div class="pink">Wait a second. Check it out.</div>
    <div class="orange">Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!</div>
    <div class="blue">Wow.</div>
    <div class="yellow">I've never seen them this close.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">They know what it's like outside The Hive.</div>
    <div class="purple">Yeah, but some don't come back.</div>
    <div class="white">Hey, Jocks!</div>
    <div class="violet">Hi, Jocks!</div>
    <div class="red">You guys did great!</div>
    <div class="green">You're monsters!</div>
    <div class="pink">You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!</div>
    <div class="orange">I wonder where they were.</div>
    <div class="blue">I don't know.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Their day's not planned.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.</div>
    <div class="purple">You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.</div>
    <div class="white">Right.</div>
    <div class="violet">Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.</div>
    <div class="red">It's just a status symbol.</div>
    <div class="green">Bees make too much of it.</div>
    <div class="pink">Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.</div>
    <div class="orange">Those ladies?</div>
    <div class="blue">Aren't they our cousins too?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Distant. Distant.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Look at these two.</div>
    <div class="purple">Couple of Hive Harrys.</div>
    <div class="white">Let's have fun with them.</div>
    <div class="violet">It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.</div>
    <div class="red">Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!</div>
    <div class="green">He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!</div>
    <div class="pink">Oh, my!</div>
    <div class="orange">I never thought I'd knock him out.</div>
    <div class="blue">What were you doing during this?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Trying to alert the authorities.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I can autograph that.</div>
    <div class="purple">A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?</div>
    <div class="white">Yeah. Gusty.</div>
    <div class="violet">We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.</div>
    <div class="red">Six miles, huh?</div>
    <div class="green">Barry!</div>
    <div class="pink">A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.</div>
    <div class="orange">Maybe I am.</div>
    <div class="blue">You are not!</div>
    <div class="yellow">We're going 0900 at J-Gate.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">What do you think, buzzy-boy?</div>
    <div class="purple">Are you bee enough?</div>
    <div class="white">I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.</div>
    <div class="violet">Hey, Honex!</div>
    <div class="red">Dad, you surprised me.</div>
    <div class="green">You decide what you're interested in?</div>
    <div class="pink">Well, there's a lot of choices.</div>
    <div class="orange">But you only get one.</div>
    <div class="blue">Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Son, let me tell you about stirring.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.</div>
    <div class="purple">You get yourself into a rhythm.</div>
    <div class="white">It's a beautiful thing.</div>
    <div class="violet">You know, Dad, the more I think about it,</div>
    <div class="red">maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.</div>
    <div class="green">You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?</div>
    <div class="pink">That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.</div>
    <div class="orange">Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!</div>
    <div class="blue">Barry, you are so funny sometimes.</div>
    <div class="yellow">I'm not trying to be funny.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!</div>
    <div class="purple">You're gonna be a stirrer?</div>
    <div class="white">No one's listening to me!</div>
    <div class="violet">Wait till you see the sticks I have.</div>
    <div class="red">I could say anything right now.</div>
    <div class="green">I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!</div>
    <div class="pink">Let's open some honey and celebrate!</div>
    <div class="orange">Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!</div>
    <div class="blue">I'm so proud.</div>
    <div class="yellow">We're starting work today!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Today's the day.</div>
    <div class="purple">Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.</div>
    <div class="white">Yeah, right.</div>
    <div class="violet">Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...</div>
    <div class="red">Is it still available?</div>
    <div class="green">Hang on. Two left!</div>
    <div class="pink">One of them's yours! Congratulations!</div>
    <div class="red">Step to the side.</div>

    <div class="turquoise">Make your choice.</div>
    <div class="purple">You want to go first?</div>

    <div class="violet">Oh, my. What's available?</div>
    <div class="red">Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.</div>
    <div class="green">Any chance of getting the Krelman?</div>
    <div class="pink">Sure, you're on.</div>
    <div class="orange">I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.</div>
    <div class="blue">Wax monkey's always open.</div>
    <div class="yellow">The Krelman opened up again.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">What happened?</div>
    <div class="purple">A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.</div>
    <div class="white">Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.</div>
    <div class="violet">Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!</div>
    <div class="red">Oh, this is so hard!</div>

    <div class="pink">Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?</div>
    <div class="orange">Barry!</div>

    <div class="yellow">What happened to you?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Where are you?</div>

    <div class="white">Out? Out where?</div>
    <div class="violet">Out there.</div>
    <div class="red">Oh, no!</div>
    <div class="green">I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.</div>
    <div class="pink">You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?</div>
    <div class="orange">Another call coming in.</div>

    <div class="yellow">Hey, guys.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Look at that.</div>
    <div class="purple">Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?</div>
    <div class="white">Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.</div>

    <div class="yellow">So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.</div>
    <div class="purple">Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!</div>
    <div class="white">That's awful.</div>
    <div class="violet">And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!</div>

    <div class="red">Ever see pollination up close?</div>
    <div class="green">No, sir.</div>
    <div class="pink">I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.</div>
    <div class="orange">See that? It's a little bit of magic.</div>
    <div class="blue">That's amazing. Why do we do that?</div>
    <div class="yellow">That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Cool.</div>
    <div class="purple">I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?</div>
    <div class="white">Copy that visual.</div>

    <div class="green">Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.</div>
    <div class="pink">What was that?</div>
    <div class="orange">Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!</div>
    <div class="blue">That is diabolical.</div>
    <div class="yellow">It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">What's number one? Star Wars?</div>
    <div class="purple">Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.</div>
    <div class="white">No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.</div>
    <div class="violet">When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.</div>
    <div class="red">There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.</div>
    <div class="green">I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.</div>
    <div class="pink">I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.</div>
    <div class="orange">Wait! Stop! Bee!</div>
    <div class="blue">Stand back. These are winter boots.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Wait!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Don't kill him!</div>
    <div class="purple">You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!</div>
    <div class="white">Why does his life have less value than yours?</div>
    <div class="violet">Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?</div>
    <div class="red">I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.</div>
    <div class="green">My brochure!</div>
    <div class="pink">There you go, little guy.</div>
    <div class="orange">I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.</div>

    <div class="red">Bye.</div>
    <div class="green">I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.</div>
    <div class="pink">All right, here it goes.</div>
    <div class="orange">Nah.</div>
    <div class="blue">What would I say?</div>
    <div class="yellow">I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.</div>
    <div class="purple">Oh, I can't do it. Come on!</div>
    <div class="white">No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.</div>
    <div class="violet">How should I start it? "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.</div>
    <div class="red">Here she comes! Speak, you fool!</div>
    <div class="green">Hi!</div>
    <div class="pink">I'm sorry. You're talking.</div>
    <div class="orange">Yes, I know.</div>
    <div class="blue">You're talking!</div>
    <div class="yellow">I'm so sorry.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">No, it's OK. It's fine.</div>
    <div class="purple">I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.</div>
    <div class="white">Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.</div>
    <div class="violet">This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!</div>
    <div class="red">I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.</div>
    <div class="green">And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.</div>
    <div class="pink">That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.</div>
    <div class="orange">Yeah.</div>
    <div class="blue">I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!</div>
    <div class="yellow">I just want to say I'm grateful.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I'll leave now.</div>
    <div class="purple">Wait! How did you learn to do that?</div>
    <div class="white">What?</div>
    <div class="violet">The talking thing.</div>
    <div class="red">Same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.</div>
    <div class="green">That's very funny.</div>
    <div class="pink">Yeah.</div>
    <div class="orange">Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.</div>
    <div class="blue">Anyway... Can I... get you something?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Like what?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?</div>
    <div class="purple">I don't want to put you out.</div>
    <div class="white">It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.</div>
    <div class="violet">It's just coffee.</div>
    <div class="red">I hate to impose.</div>
    <div class="green">Don't be ridiculous!</div>
    <div class="pink">Actually, I would love a cup.</div>
    <div class="orange">Hey, you want rum cake?</div>
    <div class="blue">I shouldn't.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Have some.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">No, I can't.</div>
    <div class="purple">Come on!</div>
    <div class="white">I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.</div>
    <div class="violet">Where?</div>
    <div class="red">These stripes don't help.</div>
    <div class="green">You look great!</div>
    <div class="pink">I don't know if you know anything about fashion.</div>
    <div class="orange">Are you all right?</div>
    <div class="blue">No.</div>
    <div class="yellow">He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">He finally gets there.</div>
    <div class="purple">He runs up the steps into the church.</div>
    <div class="white">The wedding is on.</div>
    <div class="violet">And he says, "Watermelon?</div>
    <div class="red">I thought you said Guatemalan.</div>
    <div class="green">Why would I marry a watermelon?"</div>
    <div class="pink">Is that a bee joke?</div>
    <div class="orange">That's the kind of stuff we do.</div>
    <div class="blue">Yeah, different.</div>
    <div class="yellow">So, what are you gonna do, Barry?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">About work? I don't know.</div>
    <div class="purple">I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.</div>
    <div class="white">I know how you feel.</div>
    <div class="violet">You do?</div>
    <div class="red">Sure.</div>
    <div class="green">My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.</div>
    <div class="red">Really?</div>
    <div class="green">My only interest is flowers.</div>
    <div class="pink">Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.</div>
    <div class="orange">Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?</div>
    <div class="blue">You're in Sheep Meadow!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.</div>
    <div class="purple">Why do girls put rings on their toes?</div>
    <div class="white">Why not?</div>
    <div class="violet">It's like putting a hat on your knee.</div>
    <div class="red">Maybe I'll try that.</div>
    <div class="green">You all right, ma'am?</div>
    <div class="pink">Oh, yeah. Fine.</div>
    <div class="orange">Just having two cups of coffee!</div>
    <div class="blue">Anyway, this has been great.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Thanks for the coffee.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Yeah, it's no trouble.</div>
    <div class="purple">Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.</div>
    <div class="white">Are you...?</div>
    <div class="violet">Can I take a piece of this with me?</div>
    <div class="red">Sure! Here, have a crumb.</div>
    <div class="green">Thanks!</div>
    <div class="pink">Yeah.</div>
    <div class="orange">All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.</div>
    <div class="blue">OK, Barry.</div>
    <div class="yellow">And thank you so much again... for before.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Oh, that? That was nothing.</div>
    <div class="purple">Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...</div>
    <div class="white">This can't possibly work.</div>
    <div class="violet">He's all set to go.</div>
    <div class="red">We may as well try it.</div>
    <div class="green">OK, Dave, pull the chute.</div>
    <div class="pink">Sounds amazing.</div>
    <div class="orange">It was amazing!</div>
    <div class="blue">It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Giant, scary humans!</div>
    <div class="purple">What were they like?</div>
    <div class="white">Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.</div>
    <div class="violet">They eat crazy giant things.</div>
    <div class="red">They drive crazy.</div>
    <div class="green">Do they try and kill you, like on TV?</div>
    <div class="pink">Some of them. But some of them don't.</div>
    <div class="orange">How'd you get back?</div>
    <div class="blue">Poodle.</div>
    <div class="yellow">You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">You had your "experience." Now you can pick out your job and be normal.</div>
    <div class="purple">Well...</div>
    <div class="white">Well?</div>
    <div class="violet">Well, I met someone.</div>
    <div class="red">You did? Was she Bee-ish?</div>
    <div class="green">A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!</div>
    <div class="pink">No, no, no, not a wasp.</div>
    <div class="orange">Spider?</div>
    <div class="blue">I'm not attracted to spiders.</div>
    <div class="yellow">I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">So who is she?</div>
    <div class="purple">She's... human.</div>
    <div class="white">No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.</div>
    <div class="violet">Her name's Vanessa.</div>
    <div class="red">Oh, boy.</div>
    <div class="green">She's so nice. And she's a florist!</div>
    <div class="pink">Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!</div>
    <div class="orange">We're not dating.</div>
    <div class="blue">You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!</div>
    <div class="yellow">She saved my life! And she understands me.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">This is over!</div>
    <div class="purple">Eat this.</div>
    <div class="white">This is not over! What was that?</div>
    <div class="violet">They call it a crumb.</div>
    <div class="red">It was so stingin' stripey!</div>
    <div class="green">And that's not what they eat.</div>
    <div class="pink">That's what falls off what they eat!</div>
    <div class="orange">You know what a Cinnabon is?</div>
    <div class="blue">No.</div>
    <div class="yellow">It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Sit down!</div>
    <div class="purple">...really hot!</div>
    <div class="white">Listen to me!</div>
    <div class="violet">We are not them! We're us.</div>
    <div class="red">There's us and there's them!</div>
    <div class="green">Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?</div>
    <div class="pink">There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!</div>
    <div class="orange">You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!</div>
    <div class="blue">Thinking bee.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Thinking bee.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</div>
    <div class="purple">There he is. He's in the pool.</div>
    <div class="white">You know what your problem is, Barry?</div>
    <div class="violet">I gotta start thinking bee?</div>
    <div class="red">How much longer will this go on?</div>
    <div class="green">It's been three days! Why aren't you working?</div>
    <div class="pink">I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.</div>
    <div class="orange">What life? You have no life!</div>
    <div class="blue">You have no job. You're barely a bee!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Would it kill you to make a little honey?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.</div>
    <div class="blue">Martin, would you talk to him?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Barry, I'm talking to you!</div>
    <div class="green">You coming?</div>
    <div class="purple">Got everything?</div>
    <div class="red">All set!</div>
    <div class="orange">Go ahead. I'll catch up.</div>
    <div class="pink">Don't be too long.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Watch this!</div>
    <div class="brown">Vanessa!</div>
    <div class="gray">We're still here.</div>
    <div class="blue">I told you not to yell at him.</div>
    <div class="yellow">He doesn't respond to yelling!</div>
    <div class="green">Then why yell at me?</div>
    <div class="purple">Because you don't listen!</div>
    <div class="red">I'm not listening to this.</div>
    <div class="orange">Sorry, I've gotta go.</div>
    <div class="pink">Where are you going?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I'm meeting a friend.</div>
    <div class="brown">A girl? Is this why you can't decide?</div>
    <div class="gray">Bye.</div>
    <div class="blue">I just hope she's Bee-ish.</div>
    <div class="yellow">They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?</div>
    <div class="green">To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!</div>
    <div class="purple">Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.</div>
    <div class="red">A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?</div>
    <div class="orange">No. All right, I've got one.</div>
    <div class="pink">How come you don't fly everywhere?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.</div>
    <div class="brown">Yeah, OK, I see, I see.</div>
    <div class="gray">All right, your turn.</div>
    <div class="blue">TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!</div>
    <div class="yellow">You don't have that?</div>
    <div class="green">We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.</div>
    <div class="purple">Oh, my.</div>
    <div class="red">Dumb bees!</div>
    <div class="orange">You must want to sting all those jerks.</div>
    <div class="pink">We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">So you have to watch your temper.</div>
    <div class="brown">Very carefully.</div>
    <div class="gray">You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.</div>
    <div class="blue">Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Yeah.</div>
    <div class="green">What is wrong with you?!</div>
    <div class="purple">It's a bug.</div>
    <div class="red">He's not bothering anybody.</div>
    <div class="orange">Get out of here, you creep!</div>
    <div class="pink">What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Yeah, it was. How did you know?</div>
    <div class="brown">It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.</div>
    <div class="gray">You've really got that down to a science.</div>
    <div class="blue">I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.</div>
    <div class="yellow">I'll bet.</div>
    <div class="green">What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?</div>
    <div class="purple">How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?</div>
    <div class="red">Is he that actor?</div>
    <div class="orange">I never heard of him.</div>
    <div class="pink">Why is this here?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">For people. We eat it.</div>
    <div class="brown">You don't have enough food of your own?</div>
    <div class="gray">Well, yes.</div>
    <div class="blue">How do you get it?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Bees make it.</div>
    <div class="green">I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!</div>
    <div class="purple">There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!</div>
    <div class="red">It's organic.</div>
    <div class="orange">It's our-ganic!</div>
    <div class="pink">It's just honey, Barry.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Just what?!</div>
    <div class="brown">Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!</div>
    <div class="gray">You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!</div>
    <div class="blue">And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.</div>
    <div class="yellow">I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!</div>
    <div class="green">Hey, Hector. You almost done?</div>
    <div class="purple">Almost.</div>
    <div class="red">He is here. I sense it.</div>
    <div class="orange">Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.</div>
    <div class="pink">You're busted, box boy!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I knew I heard something.</div>
    <div class="brown">So you can talk!</div>
    <div class="gray">I can talk. And now you'll start talking!</div>
    <div class="blue">Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?</div>
    <div class="yellow">I don't understand.</div>
    <div class="green">I thought we were friends.</div>
    <div class="purple">The last thing we want to do is upset bees!</div>
    <div class="red">You're too late! It's ours now!</div>
    <div class="orange">You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!</div>
    <div class="pink">You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!</div>
    <div class="brown">Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!</div>
    <div class="gray">Crazy person!</div>
    <div class="blue">What horrible thing has happened here?</div>
    <div class="yellow">These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere!</div>
    <div class="green">Just keep still.</div>
    <div class="purple">What? You're not dead?</div>
    <div class="red">Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?</div>
    <div class="orange">To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.</div>
    <div class="blue">I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!</div>
    <div class="yellow">I'm going to Tacoma.</div>
    <div class="green">And you?</div>
    <div class="purple">He really is dead.</div>
    <div class="red">All right.</div>
    <div class="orange">Uh-oh!</div>
    <div class="pink">What is that?!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Oh, no!</div>
    <div class="brown">A wiper! Triple blade!</div>
    <div class="gray">Triple blade?</div>
    <div class="blue">Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!</div>
    <div class="green">How much do you people need to see?!</div>
    <div class="purple">Open your eyes!</div>
    <div class="red">Stick your head out the window!</div>
    <div class="orange">From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell.</div>
    <div class="pink">But don't kill no more bugs!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Bee!</div>
    <div class="brown">Moose blood guy!!</div>
    <div class="gray">You hear something?</div>
    <div class="blue">Like what?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Like tiny screaming.</div>
    <div class="green">Turn off the radio.</div>
    <div class="purple">Whassup, bee boy?</div>
    <div class="red">Hey, Blood.</div>
    <div class="orange">Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.</div>
    <div class="pink">Wow!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.</div>
    <div class="brown">Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.</div>
    <div class="gray">It's a close community.</div>
    <div class="blue">Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.</div>
    <div class="yellow">What if you get in trouble?</div>
    <div class="green">You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!</div>
    <div class="purple">At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.</div>
    <div class="red">Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.</div>
    <div class="orange">You got to be kidding me!</div>
    <div class="pink">Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Hey, guys!</div>
    <div class="brown">Mooseblood!</div>
    <div class="gray">I knew I'd catch y'all down here.</div>
    <div class="blue">Did you bring your crazy straw?</div>
    <div class="yellow">We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.</div>
    <div class="green">What is this place?</div>
    <div class="purple">A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.</div>
    <div class="red">They are pinheads!</div>
    <div class="orange">Pinhead.</div>
    <div class="pink">Check out the new smoker.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!</div>
    <div class="brown">Smoker?</div>
    <div class="gray">Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.</div>
    <div class="blue">They make the honey, and we make the money.</div>
    <div class="yellow">"They make the honey, and we make the money"?</div>
    <div class="green">Oh, my!</div>
    <div class="purple">What's going on? Are you OK?</div>
    <div class="red">Yeah. It doesn't last too long.</div>
    <div class="orange">Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?</div>
    <div class="pink">Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen!</div>
    <div class="brown">What is this?</div>
    <div class="gray">Oh, no!</div>
    <div class="blue">There's hundreds of them!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Bee honey.</div>
    <div class="green">Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!</div>
    <div class="purple">This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.</div>
    <div class="red">Oh, Barry, stop.</div>
    <div class="orange">Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.</div>
    <div class="pink">Do these look like rumors?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?</div>
    <div class="brown">He's been talking to humans.</div>
    <div class="gray">What? Talking to humans?!</div>
    <div class="blue">He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Make out? Barry!</div>
    <div class="green">We do not.</div>
    <div class="purple">You wish you could.</div>
    <div class="red">Whose side are you on?</div>
    <div class="orange">The bees!</div>
    <div class="blue">I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?</div>
    <div class="green">I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!</div>
    <div class="purple">Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.</div>
    <div class="red">I remember that.</div>
    <div class="orange">What right do they have to our honey?</div>
    <div class="pink">We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Even if it's true, what can one bee do?</div>
    <div class="brown">Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye!</div>
    <div class="gray">That would hurt.</div>
    <div class="blue">No.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Up the nose? That's a killer.</div>
    <div class="green">There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.</div>
    <div class="purple">Hive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source.</div>

    <div class="blue">Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Did you ever think, "I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this"?</div>
    <div class="green">Bees have never been afraid to change the world.</div>
    <div class="purple">What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?</div>
    <div class="red">Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.</div>
    <div class="orange">We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.</div>
    <div class="pink">How old are you?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.</div>
    <div class="brown">You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.</div>
    <div class="gray">It's a common name. Next week...</div>
    <div class="blue">He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...</div>
    <div class="yellow">Next week...</div>
    <div class="green">Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.</div>
    <div class="purple">Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.</div>
    <div class="red">Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.</div>
    <div class="orange">In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!</div>
    <div class="pink">It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Honey, her backhand's a joke!</div>
    <div class="brown">I'm not gonna take advantage of that?</div>
    <div class="gray">Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.</div>
    <div class="blue">Is that that same bee?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Yes, it is!</div>
    <div class="green">I'm helping him sue the human race.</div>
    <div class="purple">Hello.</div>
    <div class="red">Hello, bee.</div>
    <div class="orange">This is Ken.</div>
    <div class="pink">Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Why does he talk again?</div>
    <div class="brown">Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.</div>
    <div class="gray">But it's our yogurt night!</div>
    <div class="blue">Bye-bye.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Why is yogurt night so difficult?!</div>
    <div class="green">You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!</div>
    <div class="purple">Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.</div>
    <div class="red">Frosting...</div>
    <div class="orange">How many sugars?</div>
    <div class="pink">Just one. I try not to use the competition.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">So why are you helping me?</div>
    <div class="brown">Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.</div>
    <div class="gray">Those are great, if you're three.</div>
    <div class="blue">And artificial flowers.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Oh, those just get me psychotic!</div>
    <div class="green">Yeah, me too.</div>
    <div class="purple">Bent stingers, pointless pollination.</div>
    <div class="red">Bees must hate those fake things!</div>
    <div class="orange">Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.</div>
    <div class="pink">Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.</div>
    <div class="brown">I guess.</div>
    <div class="gray">You sure you want to go through with it?</div>
    <div class="blue">Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, "Honey, I'm home," without paying a royalty!</div>
    <div class="yellow">It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.</div>
    <div class="green">What have we gotten into here, Barry?</div>
    <div class="purple">It's pretty big, isn't it?</div>
    <div class="red">I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.</div>
    <div class="orange">You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?</div>
    <div class="pink">Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">What's the matter?</div>
    <div class="brown">I don't know, I just got a chill.</div>
    <div class="gray">Well, if it isn't the bee team.</div>
    <div class="blue">You boys work on this?</div>
    <div class="yellow">All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding</div>
    <div class="blue">All right. Case number 4475, Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?</div>
    <div class="green">A privilege.</div>
    <div class="purple">Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?</div>
    <div class="red">I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.</div>
    <div class="orange">Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.</div>
    <div class="pink">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.</div>
    <div class="brown">I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!</div>
    <div class="gray">Talking bee!</div>
    <div class="blue">How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?</div>
    <div class="yellow">They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!</div>
    <div class="green">Mr. Benson?</div>
    <div class="purple">Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.</div>
    <div class="red">Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!</div>
    <div class="orange">I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!</div>
    <div class="pink">I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Call your first witness.</div>
    <div class="brown">So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.</div>
    <div class="gray">I suppose so.</div>
    <div class="blue">I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.</div>
    <div class="green">Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.</div>
    <div class="purple">I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?</div>
    <div class="red">No.</div>
    <div class="orange">I couldn't hear you.</div>
    <div class="pink">No.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.</div>
    <div class="brown">They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.</div>
    <div class="gray">You mean like this?</div>
    <div class="blue">Bears kill bees!</div>
    <div class="yellow">How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.</div>
    <div class="green">So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?</div>
    <div class="purple">I was with a band called The Police.</div>
    <div class="red">But you've never been a police officer, have you?</div>
    <div class="orange">No, I haven't.</div>
    <div class="pink">No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Oh, please.</div>
    <div class="brown">Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!</div>
    <div class="gray">That's not his real name?! You idiots!</div>
    <div class="blue">Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Thank you. Thank you.</div>
    <div class="green">I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.</div>
    <div class="purple">I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?</div>
    <div class="red">Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?</div>
    <div class="orange">Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!</div>
    <div class="pink">This isn't a goodfella.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">This is a badfella!</div>
    <div class="brown">Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!</div>
    <div class="gray">Order in this court!</div>
    <div class="blue">You're all thinking it!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Order! Order, I say!</div>
    <div class="green">Say it!</div>
    <div class="purple">Mr. Liotta, please sit down!</div>
    <div class="red">I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.</div>
    <div class="orange">Are we doing everything right, legally?</div>
    <div class="pink">I'm a florist.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Right. Well, here's to a great team.</div>
    <div class="brown">To a great team!</div>
    <div class="gray">Well, hello.</div>
    <div class="blue">Ken!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Hello.</div>
    <div class="green">I didn't think you were coming.</div>
    <div class="purple">No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.</div>
    <div class="red">I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.</div>
    <div class="orange">Oh, that was lucky.</div>
    <div class="pink">There's a little left. I could heat it up.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.</div>
    <div class="brown">So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.</div>
    <div class="gray">That's where I usually sit. Right... there.</div>
    <div class="blue">Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.</div>
    <div class="yellow">You think I don't see what you're doing?</div>
    <div class="green">I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.</div>
    <div class="purple">Do we?</div>
    <div class="red">Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.</div>
    <div class="orange">That's just what I was thinking about doing.</div>
    <div class="pink">Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I'm going to drain the old stinger.</div>
    <div class="brown">Yeah, you do that.</div>
    <div class="gray">Look at that.</div>
    <div class="blue">You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.</div>
    <div class="yellow">What's that?</div>
    <div class="green">Italian Vogue.</div>
    <div class="purple">Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.</div>
    <div class="red">A lot of ads.</div>
    <div class="orange">Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?</div>
    <div class="pink">Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I love the smell of flowers.</div>
    <div class="brown">How do you like the smell of flames?!</div>
    <div class="gray">Not as much.</div>
    <div class="blue">Water bug! Not taking sides!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!</div>
    <div class="green">This is pathetic!</div>
    <div class="purple">I've got issues!</div>
    <div class="red">Well, well, well, a royal flush!</div>
    <div class="orange">You're bluffing.</div>
    <div class="pink">Am I?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Surf's up, dude!</div>
    <div class="brown">Poo water!</div>
    <div class="gray">That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings!</div>
    <div class="blue">Kenneth! What are you doing?!</div>
    <div class="yellow">You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!</div>
    <div class="green">We need to talk! He's just a little bee!</div>
    <div class="purple">And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!</div>
    <div class="red">Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?</div>
    <div class="orange">No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!</div>
    <div class="pink">Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...</div>
    <div class="turquoise">My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!</div>
    <div class="brown">Goodbye, Ken.</div>
    <div class="gray">And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!</div>
    <div class="blue">I'm sorry about all that.</div>
    <div class="yellow">I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!</div>
    <div class="green">I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.</div>
    <div class="purple">Oh, well.</div>
    <div class="red">Are you OK for the trial?</div>
    <div class="orange">I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.</div>
    <div class="pink">We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...</div>
    <div class="brown">Yeah.</div>
    <div class="gray">Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.</div>
    <div class="blue">Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.</div>
    <div class="yellow">You got the tweezers?</div>
    <div class="green">Are you allergic?</div>
    <div class="purple">Only to losing, son. Only to losing.</div>
    <div class="red">Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.</div>
    <div class="orange">What exactly is your relationship to that woman?</div>
    <div class="pink">We're friends.</div>
    <div class="blue">Good friends?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Yes.</div>
    <div class="green">How good? Do you live together?</div>
    <div class="purple">Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug?</div>
    <div class="red">I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?</div>
    <div class="orange">Yeah, but...</div>
    <div class="pink">So those aren't your real parents!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Oh, Barry...</div>
    <div class="brown">Yes, they are!</div>
    <div class="gray">Hold me back!</div>
    <div class="blue">You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?</div>
    <div class="yellow">He's denouncing bees!</div>
    <div class="green">Don't y'all date your cousins?</div>
    <div class="purple">Objection!</div>
    <div class="red">I'm going to pincushion this guy!</div>
    <div class="orange">Adam, don't! It's what he wants!</div>
    <div class="pink">Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Order! Order!</div>
    <div class="brown">The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!</div>
    <div class="gray">Adam, stay with me.</div>
    <div class="blue">I can't feel my legs.</div>
    <div class="yellow">What Angel of Mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?</div>
    <div class="green">I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please!</div>
    <div class="purple">The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed Turn Against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.</div>
    <div class="red">Hey, buddy.</div>
    <div class="orange">Hey.</div>
    <div class="pink">Is there much pain?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Yeah.</div>
    <div class="brown">I... I blew the whole case, didn't I?</div>
    <div class="gray">It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.</div>
    <div class="blue">I'd be better off dead. Look at me.</div>
    <div class="yellow">They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it.</div>
    <div class="green">What was it like to sting someone?</div>
    <div class="purple">I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!</div>
    <div class="red">All right.</div>
    <div class="orange">You think it was all a trap?</div>
    <div class="pink">Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.</div>
    <div class="brown">What will the humans do to us if they win?</div>
    <div class="gray">I don't know.</div>
    <div class="blue">I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!</div>
    <div class="green">Oh, my.</div>
    <div class="purple">Could you get a nurse to close that window?</div>
    <div class="red">Why?</div>
    <div class="orange">The smoke.</div>
    <div class="pink">Bees don't smoke.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Right. Bees don't smoke.</div>
    <div class="brown">Bees don't smoke!</div>
    <div class="gray">But some bees are smoking.</div>
    <div class="blue">That's it! That's our case!</div>
    <div class="yellow">It is? It's not over?</div>
    <div class="green">Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.</div>
    <div class="purple">Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.</div>
    <div class="red">And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.</div>
    <div class="orange">Mr. Flayman.</div>
    <div class="pink">Yes? Yes, Your Honor!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Where is the rest of your team?</div>
    <div class="brown">Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time.</div>
    <div class="gray">I actually heard a funny story about...</div>
    <div class="blue">Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?</div>
    <div class="yellow">They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.</div>
    <div class="green">I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!</div>
    <div class="purple">Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.</div>
    <div class="red">But you can't! We have a terrific case.</div>
    <div class="orange">Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun!</div>
    <div class="pink">Hold it, Your Honor!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun.</div>
    <div class="brown">What is that?</div>
    <div class="gray">It's a bee smoker!</div>
    <div class="blue">What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or non?" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?</div>
    <div class="green">What are we gonna do?</div>
    <div class="purple">He's playing the species card.</div>
    <div class="red">Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!</div>
    <div class="orange">Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees!</div>
    <div class="pink">The court finds in favor of the bees!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Vanessa, we won!</div>
    <div class="brown">I knew you could do it! High-five!</div>
    <div class="gray">Sorry.</div>
    <div class="blue">I'm OK! You know what this means?</div>
    <div class="yellow">All the honey will finally belong to the bees.</div>
    <div class="blue">Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.</div>
    <div class="yellow">This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.</div>
    <div class="green">You'll regret this.</div>
    <div class="purple">Barry, how much honey is out there?</div>
    <div class="red">All right. One at a time.</div>
    <div class="orange">Barry, who are you wearing?</div>
    <div class="pink">My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">What if Montgomery's right?</div>
    <div class="brown">What do you mean?</div>
    <div class="gray">We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?</div>
    <div class="blue">First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.</div>
    <div class="yellow">We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods.</div>
    <div class="green">Wait for my signal. Take him out.</div>
    <div class="purple">He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.</div>
    <div class="red">And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...</div>
    <div class="orange">But it's just a prance-about stage name!</div>
    <div class="pink">...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Can't breathe.</div>
    <div class="brown">Bring it in, boys!</div>
    <div class="gray">Hold it right there! Good. Tap it.</div>
    <div class="blue">Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups and there's gallons more coming!</div>
    <div class="yellow">I think we need to shut down!</div>
    <div class="green">Shut down? We've never shut down.</div>
    <div class="purple">Shut down honey production!</div>
    <div class="red">Stop making honey!</div>
    <div class="orange">Turn your key, sir!</div>
    <div class="pink">What do we do now?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Cannonball!</div>
    <div class="brown">We're shutting honey production! Mission abort.</div>
    <div class="gray">Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.</div>
    <div class="blue">Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Oh, yeah?</div>
    <div class="green">What's going on? Where is everybody?</div>
    <div class="purple">Are they out celebrating?</div>
    <div class="red">They're home.</div>
    <div class="orange">They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.</div>
    <div class="pink">I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">At least we got our honey back.</div>
    <div class="brown">Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy.</div>
    <div class="gray">I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.</div>
    <div class="blue">You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?</div>
    <div class="yellow">What did you want to show me?</div>
    <div class="green">This.</div>
    <div class="purple">What happened here?</div>
    <div class="red">That is not the half of it.</div>
    <div class="orange">Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting.</div>
    <div class="pink">Doesn't look very good, does it?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">No.</div>
    <div class="brown">And whose fault do you think that is?</div>
    <div class="gray">You know, I'm gonna guess bees.</div>
    <div class="blue">Bees?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Specifically, me.</div>
    <div class="green">I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.</div>
    <div class="purple">It's not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. That's our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course...</div>
    <div class="red">The human species?</div>
    <div class="orange">So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it?</div>
    <div class="pink">I know this is also partly my fault.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">How about a suicide pact?</div>
    <div class="brown">How do we do it?</div>
    <div class="gray">I'll sting you, you step on me.</div>
    <div class="blue">That just kills you twice.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Right, right.</div>
    <div class="green">Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.</div>
    <div class="purple">I had to open my mouth and talk.</div>
    <div class="red">Vanessa?</div>
    <div class="orange">Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?</div>
    <div class="pink">To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the Last Chance I'll ever have to see it.</div>
    <div class="brown">Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.</div>
    <div class="gray">I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses!</div>
    <div class="blue">Vanessa!</div>
    <div class="blue">Roses?!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Barry?</div>
    <div class="green">Roses are flowers!</div>
    <div class="purple">Yes, they are.</div>
    <div class="red">Flowers, bees, pollen!</div>
    <div class="orange">I know.</div>
    <div class="pink">That's why this is the last parade.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Maybe not.</div>
    <div class="brown">Could you ask him to slow down?</div>
    <div class="gray">Could you slow down?</div>
    <div class="blue">Barry!</div>
    <div class="yellow">OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.</div>
    <div class="green">Yes, it kind of is.</div>
    <div class="purple">I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse.</div>
    <div class="red">Actually, it's completely closed down.</div>
    <div class="orange">I thought maybe you were remodeling.</div>
    <div class="pink">But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I don't want to hear it!</div>
    <div class="brown">All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.</div>
    <div class="gray">I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.</div>
    <div class="blue">All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. Bees. Park. Pollen!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Flowers. Repollination! Across the nation!</div>
    <div class="green">Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight.</div>
    <div class="purple">I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real.</div>
    <div class="red">Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.</div>
    <div class="orange">Thank you. It was a gift.</div>
    <div class="pink">Once inside, we just pick the right float.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">How about The Princess and the Pea?</div>
    <div class="brown">I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!</div>
    <div class="gray">Yes, I got it. Where should I sit?</div>
    <div class="blue">What are you?</div>
    <div class="yellow">I believe I'm the pea.</div>
    <div class="green">The pea? It goes under the mattresses.</div>
    <div class="purple">Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.</div>
    <div class="red">I'm getting the marshal.</div>
    <div class="orange">You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!</div>
    <div class="pink">Let's see what this baby'll do.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Hey, what are you doing?!</div>
    <div class="brown">Then all we do is blend in with traffic... without arousing suspicion.</div>
    <div class="gray">Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.</div>
    <div class="blue">Stop! Security.</div>
    <div class="yellow">You and your insect pack your float?</div>
    <div class="green">Yes.</div>
    <div class="purple">Has it been in your possession the entire time?</div>
    <div class="red">Would you remove your shoes?</div>
    <div class="orange">Remove your stinger.</div>
    <div class="pink">It's part of me.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.</div>
    <div class="brown">Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.</div>
    <div class="gray">Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!</div>
    <div class="blue">I think this is gonna work. It's got to work.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.</div>
    <div class="green">Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.</div>
    <div class="purple">I gotta get up there and talk to them.</div>
    <div class="red">Be careful.</div>
    <div class="orange">Can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.</div>
    <div class="pink">Captain, I'm in a real situation. What'd you say, Hal?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Nothing. Bee!</div>
    <div class="brown">Don't freak out! My entire species...</div>
    <div class="gray">What are you doing?</div>
    <div class="blue">Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Who's an attorney?</div>
    <div class="green">Don't move.</div>
    <div class="purple">Oh, Barry.</div>
    <div class="red">Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry!</div>
    <div class="blue">What happened here?</div>
    <div class="yellow">There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.</div>
    <div class="green">One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!</div>
    <div class="purple">Is that another bee joke?</div>
    <div class="red">No!</div>
    <div class="orange">No one's flying the plane!</div>
    <div class="pink">This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.</div>
    <div class="brown">Where's the pilot?</div>
    <div class="gray">He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.</div>
    <div class="blue">Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?</div>
    <div class="yellow">As a matter of fact, there is.</div>
    <div class="green">Who's that?</div>
    <div class="purple">Barry Benson.</div>
    <div class="red">From the honey trial?! Oh, great.</div>
    <div class="orange">Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.</div>
    <div class="pink">It's got giant wings, huge engines.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">I can't fly a plane.</div>
    <div class="brown">Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?</div>
    <div class="gray">Yes.</div>
    <div class="blue">How hard could it be?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Wait, Barry!</div>
    <div class="green">We're headed into some lightning.</div>
    <div class="purple">This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing.</div>
    <div class="red">Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...</div>
    <div class="orange">That's Barry!</div>
    <div class="pink">...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Flowers?!</div>
    <div class="brown">We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.</div>
    <div class="gray">Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.</div>
    <div class="blue">I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.</div>
    <div class="yellow">They've done enough damage.</div>
    <div class="green">But isn't he your only hope?</div>
    <div class="purple">Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.</div>
    <div class="red">Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times?</div>
    <div class="orange">"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."</div>
    <div class="pink">Get this on the air!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Got it.</div>
    <div class="brown">Stand by.</div>
    <div class="gray">We're going live.</div>
    <div class="blue">The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.</div>
    <div class="yellow">But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference.</div>
    <div class="green">More than we realized. To us, to everyone.</div>
    <div class="purple">That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.</div>
    <div class="red">We get behind a fellow.</div>
    <div class="orange">Black and yellow!</div>
    <div class="pink">Hello!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Left, right, down, hover.</div>
    <div class="brown">Hover?</div>
    <div class="gray">Forget hover.</div>
    <div class="blue">This isn't so hard.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Beep-beep! Beep-beep!</div>
    <div class="green">Barry, what happened?!</div>
    <div class="purple">Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.</div>
    <div class="red">That may have been helping me.</div>
    <div class="orange">And now we're not!</div>
    <div class="pink">So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!</div>
    <div class="brown">Move out!</div>
    <div class="gray">Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!</div>
    <div class="blue">Don't have to yell.</div>
    <div class="yellow">I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.</div>
    <div class="green">It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!</div>
    <div class="purple">It's not a tone. I'm panicking!</div>
    <div class="red">I can't do this!</div>
    <div class="orange">Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!</div>
    <div class="pink">You snap out of it.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">You snap out of it.</div>
    <div class="brown">You snap out of it!</div>
    <div class="gray">You snap out of it!</div>
    <div class="blue">You snap out of it!</div>
    <div class="yellow">You snap out of it!</div>
    <div class="green">You snap out of it!</div>
    <div class="purple">You snap out of it!</div>
    <div class="yellow">You snap out of it!</div>
    <div class="green">Hold it!</div>
    <div class="purple">Why? Come on, it's my turn.</div>
    <div class="red">How is the plane flying?</div>
    <div class="orange">I don't know.</div>
    <div class="pink">Hello?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?</div>
    <div class="brown">The Pollen Jocks!</div>
    <div class="gray">They do get behind a fellow.</div>
    <div class="blue">Black and yellow.</div>
    <div class="yellow">Hello.</div>
    <div class="green">All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.</div>
    <div class="purple">Where? I can't see anything. Can you?</div>
    <div class="red">No, nothing. It's all cloudy.</div>
    <div class="orange">Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.</div>
    <div class="pink">Thinking bee.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Thinking bee.</div>
    <div class="brown">Thinking bee!</div>
    <div class="gray">Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</div>
    <div class="blue">Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.</div>
    <div class="yellow">What?</div>
    <div class="green">I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.</div>
    <div class="purple">Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.</div>
    <div class="red">Bring the nose down.</div>
    <div class="orange">Thinking bee!</div>
    <div class="pink">Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">What in the world is on the tarmac?</div>
    <div class="brown">Get some lights on that!</div>
    <div class="gray">Thinking bee!</div>
    <div class="blue">Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Vanessa, aim for the flower.</div>
    <div class="green">OK.</div>
    <div class="purple">Cut the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?</div>
    <div class="red">Affirmative!</div>
    <div class="orange">Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.</div>
    <div class="pink">Land on that flower!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Ready? Full reverse!</div>
    <div class="brown">Spin it around!</div>
    <div class="gray">Not that flower! The other one!</div>
    <div class="blue">Which one?</div>
    <div class="yellow">That flower.</div>
    <div class="green">I'm aiming at the flower!</div>
    <div class="purple">That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.</div>
    <div class="red">I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees!</div>
    <div class="orange">Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.</div>
    <div class="pink">Rotate around it.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">This is insane, Barry!</div>
    <div class="brown">This's the only way I know how to fly.</div>
    <div class="gray">Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?</div>
    <div class="blue">Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!</div>
    <div class="yellow">Just drop it. Be a part of it.</div>
    <div class="green">Aim for the center!</div>
    <div class="purple">Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!</div>
    <div class="red">Come on, already.</div>
    <div class="orange">Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!</div>
    <div class="pink">Yes. No high-five!</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Right.</div>
    <div class="brown">Barry, it worked!</div>
    <div class="gray">Did you see the giant flower?</div>
    <div class="blue">What giant flower? Where? Of course</div>
    <div class="yellow">I saw the flower! That was genius!</div>
    <div class="green">Thank you.</div>
    <div class="purple">But we're not done yet.</div>
    <div class="red">Listen, everyone!</div>
    <div class="orange">This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.</div>
    <div class="pink">That means this is our Last Chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?</div>
    <div class="brown">Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains?</div>
    <div class="gray">We're bees!</div>
    <div class="blue">Keychain!</div>
    <div class="green">Then follow me! Except Keychain.</div>
    <div class="purple">Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this.</div>
    <div class="red">Yeah!</div>
    <div class="orange">I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.</div>
    <div class="pink">Oh, yeah.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">That's our Barry.</div>
    <div class="brown">Mom! The bees are back!</div>
    <div class="gray">If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!</div>
    <div class="blue">Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next?</div>
    <div class="yellow">Would you like some honey with that?</div>
    <div class="green">It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.</div>
    <div class="purple">Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.  And I don't see a nickel!</div>
    <div class="red">Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!</div>
    <div class="orange">I had no idea.</div>
    <div class="pink">Barry, I'm sorry.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">Have you got a moment?</div>
    <div class="brown">Would you excuse me?</div>
    <div class="gray">My mosquito associate will help you.</div>
    <div class="blue">Sorry I'm late.</div>
    <div class="yellow">He's a lawyer too?</div>
    <div class="green">I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.</div>
    <div class="purple">Have a great afternoon!</div>
    <div class="red">Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.</div>
    <div class="orange">No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.</div>
    <div class="pink">You're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next?</div>
    <div class="turquoise">All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.</div>
    <div class="brown">Thank you, Barry!</div>
    <div class="gray">That bee is living my life!</div>
    <div class="blue">Let it go, Kenny.</div>
    <div class="yellow">When will this nightmare end?!</div>
    <div class="green">Let it all go.</div>
    <div class="purple">Beautiful day to fly.</div>
    <div class="red">Sure is.</div>
    <div class="orange">Between you and me,</div>
    <div class="pink">I was dying to get out of that office.</div>
    <div class="turquoise">You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.</div>
    <div class="brown">Thinking bee!</div>
    <div class="gray">Me?</div>
    <div class="blue">Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.</div>
    <div class="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?</div>
    <div class="green">I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!</div>
    <div class="purple">All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.</div>
    <div class="red">I had virtually no rehearsal for that.</div>
